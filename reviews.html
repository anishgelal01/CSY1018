            <ul><h1>Sublime Text:The best code editor</h1>
            	<p>I use Sublime Text for software development as well as quickly searching the filesystem, finding particular information I'm looking for and performing batch operations on files. The business problem it addresses is being a useful tool that can supplement my primary software development in the preferred platform for the project I'm working on. For instance, when I'm using Android Studio to develop Android apps, or Xcode to develop iOS apps, I often have Sublime Text open as well for its superior search capabilities and overall ease of use. I may use Android Studio or Xcode much of the time, but I find myself regularly switching to Sublime Text for features like Find & Replace</p>

                  <p>I've had a free account for over a year and I've never received any spam, newsletters or promotional emails from them which is very rare in this day and age. I've tried four PSD downloads and they were virus free. If they used 3rd party fonts, these were not provided, so they respect others copyrights and licenses.</p>
